# In order for the examples below to work the program (update-status.sh)
# would have to be installed to /usr/local/bin/
# If you run the program manually it will test that location to see if it
# is present and if it is not it will install itself to that location.

# To trigger the program to run every hour:
0 * * * * bash /usr/local/bin/update-status.sh

# To trigger the program to run every hour and enable logging:
0 * * * * bash /usr/local/bin/update-status.sh >> ~/`hostname`-status.log
